This is the code that is used in the [How to code a Symfony 2 RESTful API with FOS REST Bundle][1] video series at [CodeReviewVideos.com][2] 

In this course you will learn how to set up, configure, and implement a RESTful API using FOS REST Bundle.

We will cover all the basics including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, along with handling collections of related data, how to leverage Symfony's awesome Forms component in a way you may never have thought of, and importantly - we will do all of this in a Test Driven Development manner.

By the end of this course you will be confident in implementing your own REST API using Symfony 2. And once you have that, you'll see how many possibilities become available to you - mobile apps, awesome AngularJS front-ends, and many more opportunities besides.

### Code For Individual Videos

**To see the code that matches up to the videos**, take a look at the [commit history][3] - the video names should match up. I know this isn't great, but it may help you with specific issues to see the code as it was at the times the videos were recorded. 

It's good stuff, so let's get cracking.
